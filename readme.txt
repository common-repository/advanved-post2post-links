With this plugin, you can easily add links to your other posts. You can also add whatever tags you the link that you'd link.

Default:
`[p2p postID="297" text="Post Title"]`

Advanced:
`[p2p postID="297" text="awesome post title" target="_blank" title="Post Title"]`

The text attribute is optional. If not provided, the post title will be used. Same with the title attribute.
